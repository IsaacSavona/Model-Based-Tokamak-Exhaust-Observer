# Summary of the Day's Progress
Went to a meeting with Gijs, Jesse and Jorn [see [EndMarchCheckpoint](EndMarchCheckpoint.md)]. Then I made some plots based on that meeting.

## Details

I am not going to repeat what is in[EndMarchCheckpoint](EndMarchCheckpoint.md), but will say there are four main tasks I should accomplish. I have worked on the first one...

### Checking the uniqueness of the state w.r.t $q_{\perp,tar}$, $T_{e,tar}$, and $\Gamma_{i,tar}$

#### <u>Method</u>: Averaged over the 98th column (i.e., the row at the interface of the target) of `shot.data.te.value`

| Metric                              |   Value    |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| Root Mean Squared Error             |   0.0938   |
| R-squared                           |   0.997    |

| Linear regression model|
|`y ~ 1 + x1 + x2` |

#### <u>Method</u>: Added up the ion fluxes for D1, [C1, C6] and [N1, N7] and averaged them over the 98th column.

| Metric                              |   Value    |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| Root Mean Squared Error             |   0.118   |
| R-squared                           |   0.984    |

|:--:|  
|Linear regression model:
    `y ~ 1 + x1^2 + x1*x2 + x2^2 + x1^3 + (x1^2):x2 + x1:(x2^2) + x1^4 + (x1^3):x2 + (x1^2):(x2^2)`|
| Metric                              |   Value    |
|-------------------------------------|------------|
| Root Mean Squared Error             |   0.0341   |
| R-squared                           |   0.991    |

#### <u>Method</u>: Took the 97th column of `shot.data.qpar` and multiplied it by the 97th column of `shot.geom.Bp./shot.geom.Btot` as in Stangeby 2018:

I assume in $q^{plasma}_{dep,t} = q^{target-heating}_{||,t}sin(\theta_{\perp})$...
- Parallel heat flux: $q^{target-heating}_{||,t}$ = `mean(shot.data.qpar(:,97))`  
- Sine of the incidence angle of **B** on the target: $sin(\theta_{\perp})$ = `shot.geom.Bp./shot.geom.Btot`


## Next Steps

- Double check $q_{\perp,tar}$, $T_{e,tar}$, and $\Gamma_{i,tar}$ show [$\bar{p}_0$ $\bar{n}_N$] is a good state choice.

### Continue with the other steps from [EndMarchCheckpoint](EndMarchCheckpoint.md):

1. Making more SynthDiag mappings

2. Making fake state dynamics with the steady-state response from SOLPS-ITER sims

3. Implementing a (linear) Kalman Filter 

## Bigger Picture
### - $f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_N)$ $\rightarrow$
### - Using $f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_N)$ part of the Kalman filter update step becomes $K(y - f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_N))$ where $y$ are the real sensor measurements and $K$ comes from (among other things) the process noise as defined by the RMSE of the fit on $f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_N)$ $\rightarrow$

### - Create Best Guess Transfer Function (BGTF) for the state model with the steady-state being derived from linear fit on input output of sims.

### - Validating/testing both Kalman Filter and $f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_N)$ comes down to using experimental data and BGTF (and eventually the FRF system identification of TCV exhaust) to update the state (i.e., the "State Model" block) in the loop with the Kalman Filter and checking that the of the KF residual has constant variance and zero mean. --> using $f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_Z)$ the kalman filter residual becomes $K(y - f(p_0, n_Z))$ where $y$ are the real sensor measurements
