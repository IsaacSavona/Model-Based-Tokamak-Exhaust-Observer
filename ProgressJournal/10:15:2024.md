## Bigger Picture
Deciding on the *outer divertor region* or *inner+outer divertor region* (or *some other area*) to define the volume average of $p_0$ and $n_Z$ and a synthetic diagnostic (=start with FIR) --> $f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_Z)$ --> using $f(\bar{p}_0, \bar{n}_Z)$ part of the kalman filter update step becomes $K(y - f(p_0, n_Z))$ where $y$ are the real sensor measurements
